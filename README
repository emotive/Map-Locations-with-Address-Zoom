This Javascript based code set displays a Google Map and 
loads an referenced KML file with points of interest on the
map.  Users can then zoom in on the map based on an address
they provide.

This code was used for early voting for the Bill Haslam for
Governor campaign.

3) Enter the full URL to your external KML file with points of interest
4) Place code anywhere on your website
